### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

# the function doesn't have an initialize method


  def checkforAce(card)
  # function name should be written in snake_case
    if card.value = 1
    # 'equal to' should be written using == 
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  # the function should start with def
  # there should be a comma between the arguments
  if card1.value > card2.value
  # the if statement should be indented
    return card
    # this should return card1
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
# one unnceccessary 'end'
# 'end' should have the same indentation as the first line of the function

def self.cards_total(cards)
# this should be an instance method not a class method ('self' is unneccessary)
  total
  # total needs to have a value
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

# class CardGame is missing an end
```
